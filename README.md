# NP-Problem-Research
The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ‘”acefg”, .. etc are subsequences of “abcdefg”. If LCS Input A = “ABCDGH” and B = “AEDFHR” then Longest common subsequence is "ADH".

# Application
The LCS has been used to study various areas such as text analysis, pattern recognition, file comparison, efficient tree matching. Biological applications of the LCS and similarity measurement are varied, from sequence alignment in comparative genomics to phylogenetic construction and analysis, to rapid search in huge biological sequences to compression and efficient storage of the rapidly expanding genomic data sets to re-sequencing a set of strings given a target string an important step in efficient genome assembly. It is also widely used by revision control systems such as Git for reconciling multiple changes made to a revision-controlled collection of files.

# Complexity
For the general case of an arbitrary number of input sequences, the problem is NP-hard. When the number of sequences is constant, the problem is solvable in polynomial time.
