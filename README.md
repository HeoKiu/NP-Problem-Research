# NP-Problem-Research
The subset sum problem is a decision problem in computer science. In its most general formulation, there is a multiset S of integers and a target-sum T, and the question is to decide whether any subset of the integers sum to precisely T. The problem is known to be NP. Moreover, some restricted variants of it are NP-complete too
